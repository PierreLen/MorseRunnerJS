# Aims

This is an experimental repository where exchanges, discussions, experiments, and actual work are channelled towards porting/rewriting Morse Runner as a (universal) webapp. 

Morse Runner is a widely known, Windows-only (http://www.dxatlas.com/morserunner/), training software for ham radio operators interested in CW. It has been developed actively for years by Alex Shovkoplyas (VE3NEA) as freeware and its (Delphi Pascal) source code has been generously released on GitHub.



## Collaborating and developing

This is an attempt at rebooting/rewriting/porting Morse Runner in JavaScript, as a webapp. It is based on the powerful audio library Web Audio (see https://web.dev/webaudio-intro/), which is the underlying layer for Fabian Kurz (DJ5CW)'s fantastic library (https://github.com/dj1yfk/jscwlib).
jscwlib should make life extremely easy. See Fabian's example for a pileup https://fkurz.net/ham/jscwlib/example/pileup.html .
