## GNU Global generated "tags"

Note: there are some extra files, generated by the GNU Global code-tagging-navigation utility. These files
will probably allow (out of the box) someone with VSCode and "Pascal v9.5.*" extension by Alessandro Fragnani
to enjoy "code navigation" (i.e. clicking on a function/variable to have the cursor placed at the
function/variable definition, within and across source files).

For internal reference, "Pascal" extension was installed and the information to get "code navigation" followed,
installing GNU Global as well as Python's Pygment library.

Within bash, two environmental variables were set:

export GTAGSCONF=/usr/local/etc/gtags.conf
export GTAGSLABEL=pygments


The following commands (perhaps the first two are redundant) were launched from bash, while in the same folder:
	- find . -name '*.pas' > pippo_list
	- gtags -vf pippo_list
	- gtags -vf

These generated the (binary) files GRTAGS, GPATH, GTAGS.

It is highly likely that leaving these three files in the code base folder, will allow anyone with VSCode and the
"Pascal" extension to do "code navigation", without the need of installing GNU Global etc. (i.e. after all the
code is "frozen" and it is here only for study and reference purposes).
